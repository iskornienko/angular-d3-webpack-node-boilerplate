# Angular/d3/webpack/node boilerplate

### Motivation (Why?)
I need to build lots of web based prototypes quickly. Looking around online, I wasn't able to find the right mix of technologies so I decided to make my own.

### Current State
Angular6+ CLI and build tools make much of this obsolete. Unless there is a good reason to use Angular1, this is probably not very usefull.

### Overview
Libraries included in the example are:
* d3
* angular
* angular route
* socket.io
* express
* request
* webpack
* production build

### Setup
`npm install`

`npm run webpack-dev`
